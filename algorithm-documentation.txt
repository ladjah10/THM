=== THE 100 MARRIAGE ASSESSMENT - FINAL ALGORITHM DOCUMENTATION ===
Lawrence Adjah's Enhanced Scoring Methodology - Updated Implementation

=== ALGORITHM SPECIFICATIONS ===

Total Assessment Weight: 623 points across 99 questions
Faith Questions: 17 questions with enhanced weights (23.6% of total assessment)

=== SECTION WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION ===
Section I: Your Foundation: 89 points (14.29%) - 9 questions
Section II: Your Faith Life: 22.5 points (3.61%) - 3 questions  
Section III: Your Marriage Life: 190 points (30.50%) - 31 questions
Section IV: Your Marriage Life with Children: 120 points (19.26%) - 20 questions
Section V: Your Family/Home Life: 32 points (5.14%) - 8 questions

Section VII: Your Health and Wellness: 47 points (7.54%) - 9 questions
Section VIII: Your Marriage and Boundaries: 70.5 points (11.32%) - 10 questions

=== RESPONSE SCORING SYSTEM ===

Declaration Questions (D):
- Option 1 (Affirmative): 100% of question weight
- Option 2 (Antithesis): 30% of question weight

Multiple Choice Questions (M):
- Option 1: 100% of question weight
- Option 2: 75% of question weight (with faith/traditional bonus)
- Option 3: 40% of question weight  
- Option 4+: 15% of question weight

Faith Question Enhancement:
- Declaration faith questions: +1 weight boost
- Multiple choice faith questions: +0.5 weight boost
- Faith-aligned responses maintain scoring advantages

=== SCORING CALCULATION FORMULAS ===

1. Section Score Calculation:
   Section Percentage = (Section Earned Points / Section Total Weight) × 100

2. Overall Score Calculation:
   Overall Score = Σ(Section Percentage × Section Weight Percentage)

3. Compatibility Score:
   Compatibility = 100 - Σ(|Section_A - Section_B| × Weight Factor)
   Weight Factor: 1.5 for faith sections (Foundation, Faith Life), 1.0 for others
