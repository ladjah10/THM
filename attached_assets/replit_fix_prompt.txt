# Fix Recommendations for THM Replit Codebase

## File: client/src/components/assessment/QuestionnaireView.tsx

1. **Prevent Runtime Crash from Undefined Options**
   - Change:
     ```tsx
     {question.options.map(...)}
     ```
   - To:
     ```tsx
     {(question.options || []).map((option, index) => (
       <RadioGroupItem key={index} value={option} id={option} />
     ))}
     ```

2. **Ensure Option Values Are Associated for Scoring**
   - Modify `onOptionSelect` handler to include a consistent value:
     ```tsx
     onOptionSelect(question.id, option, index + 1)
     ```

3. **Accessibility Enhancement**
   - Consider supporting keyboard navigation and screen readers for improved UX.

1. **Add Default Weight Fallback**
   - Change:
     ```ts
     const earned = response.value * question.weight;
     ```
   - To:
     ```ts
     const weight = question.weight ?? 1;
     const earned = response.value * weight;
     ```

2. **Validate Response Format Before Scoring**
   - Insert check before accessing response:
     ```ts
     if (!response || typeof response.value !== "number") return;
     ```

3. **Add Logging for Skipped Questions (Optional but Helpful)**
   - After skip condition:
     ```ts
     if (!response) {
       console.warn("Skipped question ID:", question.id);
       return;
     }
     ```
