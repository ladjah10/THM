YOUR FOUNDATION (Questions 1–10)
Issues:

Question 1: Incorrect. The provided question ("Biblical Model") doesn’t match the book’s Question 1 ("Your Foundation: Marriage + Family - What is your faith position?").

Question 3: Extraneous. It’s a duplicate of Question 2 and not in the book.
Questions 4–9: Mostly correct but shifted due to earlier errors. Question 4 should be Question 3, etc.
Question 10: Correct but needs title update to “Your Marriage Life: Order of Priority before God” per Table 2.
Corrective Actions:

Replace Question 2 with the book’s accountability question.

YOUR MARRIAGE LIFE CONTINUED (Questions 90–99)
Issues:

The provided list’s Questions 90–99 are partially correct but misplaced (e.g., Questions 90–93 belong earlier, Questions 94–99 are parenting-related and should be earlier).
The book’s structure includes boundaries and sex-related questions here, plus one additional question to reach 99 (likely “Secrets” or similar).
Question 95 in the provided list (“Children Decision: How To Have Them”) is incorrect and duplicates earlier parenting questions.
Corrective Actions:

Relocate Questions 90–93 to earlier slots (e.g., Questions 53, 54, 56, etc.).
Replace Questions 94–99 with correct book questions on boundaries and secrets.
Add Question 99 as “Secrets” to complete the 99-question set, assuming it’s an intentional addition.
