🔍 CODE REVIEW & IMPROVEMENT PLAN FOR THM REPOSITORY

✅ Objective
Identify bugs, logical errors, and areas for improvement across the THM repo.

🐞 BUGS & LOGICAL ERRORS

1. Incomplete or Truncated Submissions
- Issue: Some male respondents' submissions are not being saved completely.
- Recommendation:
  - Check form input length limits and ensure all POST/PUT requests correctly serialize and store data.
  - Add logging at submission and storage points to trace data flow.
  - Validate that backend saves payload consistently, especially gender-linked branching.

2. Duplicate Scores Despite Different Inputs
- Issue: Multiple users show same scores even with differing answers.
- Recommendation:
  - Check scoring logic inside fix-assessment-scores.ts and any scoring utils.
  - Verify input parsing and mapping – especially indexing of question-to-weight mappings.
  - Add unit tests to compare different answer combinations for output divergence.

🛠️ CODE IMPROVEMENTS

1. Input Validation
- Add express-validator or Joi to sanitize and validate form data server-side.
- Ensure assessment scores are calculated from verified, trusted input only.

2. Dynamic Configs
- Replace hardcoded paths (e.g., in create-simple-csv.cjs) with environment-based configs using .env and dotenv.

3. Consolidate Score Fix Scripts
- Scripts like fix-assessment-scores.ts and fix-assessment-scores-v2.ts should be unified.
- Use reusable functions and expose as a module for testing and DRYness.

---

🧪 TESTING

1. Add Unit and Integration Tests
- Install jest, ts-jest, and supertest.
- Suggested tests:
  - Assessment submission and storage flow
  - Score calculation from sample inputs
  - Admin dashboard retrievals and filters

2. Add Test Coverage Badge
- Use jest --coverage and display code coverage in README

---

🧱 CODE STYLE

1. Standardize with ESLint & Prettier
npm install eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier --save-dev
npx eslint --init
- Add .eslintrc.js and .prettierrc configs

---

🚀 DEPLOYMENT & ADMIN FIXES

1. Admin Dashboard Fix
- Issue: Admin dashboard does not show paid/arranged pool respondents.
- Steps:
  - Ensure users in the arranged pool and paid list are correctly linked in DB (user.assessment?.paid === true)
  - Fix filters in admin page query (likely in a find or filter clause in server route)

2. Show Full Report Data in Admin
- Ensure reports join across tables/models: User, Assessment, Payment, etc.
- If using MongoDB/Mongoose, use .populate() or aggregation
- If SQL/Prisma, use .include or .join

🧾 DOCUMENTATION

1. Expand README.md
Add:
- Project overview
- Setup instructions (local + deployment)
- API routes (admin, assessment, etc.)
- Contact/support info
