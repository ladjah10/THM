### üö® Replit Force Push Instructions (Use With Caution)

If your push is rejected because the remote has commits not present in your Replit project, and you are certain that you want your Replit code to **overwrite** the GitHub repo, follow these steps:

---

#### üõ† Step-by-Step (From Replit Shell)

1. Open the Replit **Shell** (Tools > Shell)

2. Run the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Force syncing Replit changes with GitHub"
git push origin main --force
```

> If you're using a different branch (e.g. `master`), replace `main` with your branch name.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:
- This will **overwrite** changes on GitHub with your current Replit code.
- Only use this if you are confident that the GitHub repo doesn't have important changes you want to keep.

---

Always double-check before using `--force`.
