I'd like to find a simple ineffective way to build in the couples assessment component with all of the infrastructure we have in place what I would like it to do is to share the same reports we have but also I would like there to be a component where it highlights strength areas potential vulnerabilities, and then it actually shares the list of questions where they each had different responses from the assessment I wonder if there's a simple way where we leverage the use of an email address so for example I go in and take the individual assessment and then I list the First Name Last name and email address of my significant Other and within the system. It then waits until that is completed or searches to see if that assessment with that email has been completed and then it compile its analysis and comparison data from that specific assessment again I still wanna have the global assessment numbers that we have right now which assesses them against other respondents but then I want there to be a couple specific section that compares that assessment to the assessment of the significant other and vice versa. The other significant other must have the email address of the other one I think this may be a simple way for us to approach building this infrastructure on the same architecture we have now.

Of course, I would like them to each get a copy of the assessment, but I think this would be effective. We would split up the analysis. There will be a section particularly on major potential vulnerabilities, which highlights the highly weighted questions and their categories and shows which questions there are differences between the spouses, particularly for the significantly waited ones, and then there would be a catch all section at the end where there are questions for discussion because there are different and it would list all of those questions as Well.

Again, I would like to add to the assessment for couples specifically sections for the couples and analysis. We would probably have in their case, the couples analysis and reporting upfront and then the global data that we currently already have as the next page or coming right after it and we would compare their overall scores and then we would point out strengths and potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses based on their matching and then we would highlight major areas of for discussion which are questions where they differ that are heavily waited. We would list the category and the actual question number to help the couple go back through their report and then even the non-weighted would have a section the ones that are not significantly waited we would have their category and the questions now keep in mind we're gonna have to put a note that if they do the couples assessment it's important for them to probably purchase the book because they'll need to actually go back through each question one by one and we're not gonna be offering them a list out of the questions when they're done let me know if this could be done in the way I'm thinking about it could be an effective and more simple way to approach it or if you have a more effective seamless way, I would welcome your recommendation.
