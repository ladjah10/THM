The current assessment is partially aligned with the book and chart, but several discrepancies exist. Below, I summarize the status for each section, followed by a detailed discrepancy table.

Section-by-Section Status
Your Foundation (1–10):
Order/Numbering: Matches the book’s sequence.
Content: Questions 1–9 are correctly updated per the chart, with exact book text and options. Question 10 is updated but titled “Marriage Priorities” instead of “Order of Priority before God.”
Chart Implementation: All updates applied correctly.
Issues: Minor title mismatch for Question 10.
Your Faith Life (11–14):
Order/Numbering: Matches book sequence.
Content: Question 11 is correctly added per the chart. Questions 12–14 are updated but Question 12 is a duplicate of 11 (both “Worship Life: Marriage”).
Chart Implementation: Question 11 addition is correct, but Question 12 should be removed or reassigned to a unique book question.
Issues: Duplicate Question 12; needs replacement with a distinct book question.
Your Marriage Life (15–35):
Order/Numbering: Partially matches book. Questions 15–23 align, but 24–35 deviate significantly.
Content: Questions 15–23 are correctly updated per the chart. Questions 24–35 include extraneous financial questions (31–35) not in the book, and Question 24’s options don’t match the book’s counseling question.
Chart Implementation: Updates for 15–23 are correct, but 24–35 were not updated/removed as recommended. The chart suggested removing financial questions (e.g., 31–35) and adding book questions like “Sex - Contraception.”
Issues: Incorrect options for Question 24; extraneous questions 31–35; missing book questions (e.g., Sex Perspective, Work Down Time).
Your Parenting Life (36–50):
Order/Numbering: Does not match book’s “Your Marriage Life with Children” section.
Content: Questions 36–50 cover parenting but include extraneous topics (e.g., Higher Education, Sports) not in the book. Book questions like “Communication & Discipline” and “Social Media (New Child)” are missing.
Chart Implementation: The chart recommended adding book questions (e.g., Communication & Discipline) at IDs like 60, but these are not present, and extraneous questions remain.
Issues: Entire section is misaligned; needs replacement with book questions.
Your Family/Home Life (51–70):
Order/Numbering: Does not match book’s “Your Family Life” section.
Content: Questions 51–70 include extraneous topics (e.g., Pets, Emergency Preparedness) not in the book. Book questions like “Traditions: Family Dinner” and “House Cleaning & Maintenance” are missing.
Chart Implementation: The chart recommended adding book questions (e.g., Family Dinner at ID 63), but these are not present.
Issues: Section is mostly extraneous; needs replacement with book questions.
Your Finances (71–79):
Order/Numbering: Partially matches book’s “Your Finances” section.
Content: Questions 71–79 are extraneous (e.g., Retirement Planning, Insurance) except for potential overlap with “Financial Planning Model” (book ID 61). Book questions like “Financial Generosity” and “Payments Execution” are missing.
Chart Implementation: The chart recommended adding book financial questions (e.g., ID 60–62), but only ID 60 was added, and extraneous questions remain.
Issues: Mostly extraneous; needs replacement with book questions.
Your Health and Wellness (80–89):
Order/Numbering: Partially matches book’s “Your Health and Wellness” section.
Content: Questions 80–83 and 87–88 align with book questions (e.g., Nutrition, Therapy), but 84–86 and 89 are extraneous (e.g., Diet Expectations, Device-Free Time).
Chart Implementation: Questions 81 and 88 were added per the chart, but extraneous questions were not removed.
Issues: Extraneous questions 84–86, 89; missing book questions (e.g., Exercise).
Your Marriage Life with Children (90–99):
Order/Numbering: Partially matches book’s “Your Marriage Life with Children” section.
Content: Questions 90–93 and 94–99 align with book questions (e.g., Sex - Initiation, Children Decisions), but their placement at 90–99 is incorrect (should be earlier, e.g., with Sex Life questions).
Chart Implementation: Question 59 (Sex - Contraception) was added, but its placement should be earlier (e.g., ID 48, per book order).
Issues: Misplaced questions; missing book questions (e.g., Communication: Sex/Gender).
Discrepancy Table
The table below lists discrepancies, confirms chart implementation, and provides corrective actions for Replit. I’ve mapped book questions to their intended IDs based on their sequence, adjusting for the 99-question limit. Extraneous questions are replaced with missing book questions in their correct order.
