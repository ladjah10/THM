‚úÖ Code Review Notes: THM Assessment System

üìå Summary
This file contains a breakdown of bugs, logic issues, and recommended fixes across key scripts in the THM assessment project.

---

1. fix-assessment-issues.ts

Purpose:  
Processes incomplete assessments and recalculates scores using full responses.

Issues + Fixes:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing per-record try/catch. Add inside the for-loop to isolate failures.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No pagination ‚Äî add LIMIT and OFFSET in queries to prevent memory overload.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Weak logging ‚Äî log email, timestamp, and error message for each failure.

Example Fix:
for (const row of rows) {
  try {
    // process...
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Failed to process ${row.email} at ${row.timestamp}:`, err.message);
  }
}

2. fix-assessment-scores.ts

Purpose:  
Fixes scoring bug where many users showed a default 67.3% score.

Issues + Fixes:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Question mappings are hardcoded ‚Äî extract to config or schema file.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No input validation ‚Äî check that response values exist and are numbers.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No change log ‚Äî consider writing updated results to a .json or DB audit table.

Example Fix:
if (!response || typeof response.value !== 'number') {
  console.warn(`Invalid response detected for user ${email}. Skipping.`);
  continue;
}

---

3. fix-assessment-scores-v2.ts

Purpose:  
Improved scoring system based on profile logic and section weighting.

Issues + Fixes:
- ‚úÖ Uses frontend-aligned psychographicProfiles (great!)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still lacks fallbacks if a profile isn‚Äôt matched.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Paths may break in builds ‚Äî use path.resolve() for safe loading.

Extra Suggestion:  
Allow passing a profile as CLI input or reading dynamic JSON.

4. generate-real-couple-pdf.ts

Purpose:  
Generates a couple‚Äôs PDF report for testing layout and accuracy.

Issues + Fixes:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Hardcoded name/email/PII ‚Äî abstract these or scrub in commits.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No error handling for PDF generation ‚Äî wrap in try/catch.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No output path confirmation ‚Äî log file location after write.

Example Fix:
try {
  await generateCoupleAssessmentPDF(assessment, outputPath);
  console.log(`‚úÖ PDF saved at: ${outputPath}`);
} catch (err) {
  console.error("PDF generation failed:", err);
}

---

5. drizzle.config.ts

Purpose:  
Drizzle ORM setup for schema and migrations.

Issues + Fixes:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumes process.env is preloaded ‚Äî add dotenv.config() at top of file.
- ‚úÖ Good validation of DATABASE_URL.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider using path.resolve(__dirname, 'shared/schema.ts') for portability.

‚úÖ Next Steps

- [ ] Add per-record error handling
- [ ] Implement batch/pagination for large queries
- [ ] Replace hardcoded mappings with dynamic config
- [ ] Add audit trail/logging for scoring changes
- [ ] Sanitize or abstract static test data
