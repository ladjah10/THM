 I’m sharing my feedback in 2 sections, copy edits and some UI refinement with files to guide (you can use as reference to update relevant files) 
Part 1: Line-by-Line Copy Edits The current copy is functional but lacks emotional resonance, clarity, and a compelling call to action. It also doesn’t fully highlight the unique value of the assessment or the transformative outcomes for the user. Here’s the revised copy with detailed edits for each line, aiming to make it more persuasive and aligned with the goals of fostering compatibility, growth, and a faith-centered relationship.  ***  The 100 Marriage Assessment – Series 1: Align Expectations, Build Your Future

The current design on the Replit page (https://the100marriageassessment25.replit.app/assessment) is minimalistic but lacks visual hierarchy, emotional appeal, and a professional feel. Drawing inspiration from Prepare/Enrich (https://www.prepare-enrich.com/), which uses a clean layout, warm imagery, and clear value propositions, I’ll propose a revamped UI that enhances the structure while making it more engaging and aligned with the assessment’s goals. The design will emphasize the value and outcomes (compatibility, growth, faith-centered marriage) through visuals, typography, and layout.
Current Structure (Replit Page Analysis)
* Header: Simple title ("The 100 Marriage Assessment – Series 1") with copyright notice.
* Main Content: A centered card with the assessment description, benefits list, and payment form.
* Payment Section: Basic form with card input fields and a "Pay $49 and Continue" button.
* Footer: Terms and privacy policy text.
UI Design Goals
1. Visual Appeal: Use warm, faith-inspired imagery (e.g., a couple holding hands, soft gradients) and a professional color scheme (blue and gold tones to symbolize trust and value).
2. Value and Outcomes: Highlight the transformative outcomes with a hero section, testimonials, and a clear benefits section.
3. User-Friendly Flow: Improve the layout with better typography, spacing, and a call-to-action button that stands out.
4. Comparables Inspiration (Prepare/Enrich):
    * Hero section with a couple image and bold headline.
    * Benefits section with icons or visuals for each point.
    * Testimonials or trust signals (e.g., "Trusted by 1,000+ couples").
    * Clean payment form with a professional look.
Revamped UI Design Plan
