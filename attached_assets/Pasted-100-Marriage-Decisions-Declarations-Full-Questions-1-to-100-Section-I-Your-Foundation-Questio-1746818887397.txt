Scripture:





1 Corinthians 7:1-6 NIV / Now for the matters you wrote about: "It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman." ${2}$ But since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each woman with her own husband. ${3}$ The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. ${4}$ The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife. ${5}$ Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
